Nash solution search algorithm
==============================
This is an implementation of the Nash solution search algorithm described [here](http://joshpeterson.github.io/a-brief-introduction-to-nash-games/). It is written in Clojure.

The CLR [branch](https://github.com/joshpeterson/nash-clojure/tree/CLR) includes changes to the normal code which allow the code to run using [clojure-clr](https://github.com/clojure/clojure-clr).
